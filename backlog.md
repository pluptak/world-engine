# Backlog

One item = one small block: plan it, build it, `npm run check`, review the diff, commit. Each item
keeps every invariant in AGENTS.md (determinism, pure core, `canonicalJson`, no prose,
coverage-governed `"unknown"`). Delete an item in the same commit that ships it — git history
records it; `docs/` describes what is built (index: `docs/DESIGN.md`).
Measurements and test results live in `docs/measurements.md`, not here; an item quotes a number only
when the item is about that number.

**Scope line.** The engine is a library: a typed, in-process API through which a caller manipulates
objects, humans and animals and asks about the world. The CLI is one thin adapter over that API, and
there is no web server. Turning prose or intent into calls, and choosing calls that reach a desired
world state, is the job of a middleware that does not exist and is not part of this project. Items
below may make the API easier for such a caller to drive (describing its own commands, dry-running
one, structured refusals), but never interpret text or plan on a caller's behalf.

## How the work runs in parallel

P lands first, on `main`. Then lanes A–D run at the same time, one agent per lane, each in its own
git worktree and branch; a lane's items run in order. Each finished item is rebased on `main`,
passes `npm run check`, is reviewed, and merges one at a time. Lane Z starts once A–D have merged.

- **Owned files:** a lane edits only the files its items name, plus the shared registration points.
- **Shared registration points** — `src/engine/verbs/index.ts`, `src/errors.ts`, `src/contract.ts`,
  the verb table in `tests/property-gen.ts`, the verb list in `docs/verbs.md`, `CLAUDE.md` — take
  additions only, one line or one entry per change, so concurrent lanes conflict at most trivially.
- **No lane changes another lane's semantics.** If an item needs that, it stops and says so.

## Out of scope

- Prose or intent → calls, and planning calls toward a goal state: the middleware's job.
- A web/HTTP server: the API is in-process; the CLI is the only adapter.
- Any Story-writer integration: a decision for that repo, if a middleware ever exists.
- The social resolver (mechanical state only: `alert`, `locked_by_order`), a generic relation graph,
  and continuous physics (Rapier/Box2D): revisit only when a concrete world needs them.
- The limits in `docs/limits.md`, reassessed after the inn: none is worth a verb yet. Facing and a
  sight cone (an unseen act in a lit room) is the costliest and the first to revisit, when a
  concrete world needs what darkness, concealment and staging cannot give.

## Items

Every item is ready now, and names anything it leans on; they can be taken in any order.

### Property check: nobody learns words they did not hear

`tests/speech.test.ts` shows one whisper not reaching one observer. The rule is general, so the property
test should hold it over random runs.

- **Check** (in `tests/property.test.ts`, with the generator's `say` already in the verb table): after each
  step of a run, for every agent: each `say` in `since(0)` whose hearing is not true for that agent
  (`perceive` with the event, either end) appears in `observe(agent, { since: 0 })` without `utterance` and
  `volume`, and each one it did hear appears with both; and the agent's `command(..., { observe: true })`
  projection obeys the same. Counters assert that the run produced both kinds (heard and only-seen) so
  the check cannot pass empty.
- **Generator:** add a `say` weight where agents are in different rooms or at distances over the
  threshold, if the existing scenario does not already produce whispers out of earshot.
- **Depends on:** nothing.
