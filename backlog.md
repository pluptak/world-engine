# Backlog

One item = one small block: plan it, build it, `npm run check`, review the diff, commit. Each item
keeps every invariant in AGENTS.md (determinism, pure core, `canonicalJson`, no prose,
coverage-governed `"unknown"`). Delete an item in the same commit that ships it — git history
records it; `docs/` describes what is built (index: `docs/DESIGN.md`).
Measurements and test results live in `docs/measurements.md`, not here; an item quotes a number only
when the item is about that number.

**Scope line.** The engine is a library: a typed, in-process API through which a caller manipulates
objects, humans and animals and asks about the world. The CLI is one thin adapter over that API, and
there is no web server. Turning prose or intent into calls, and choosing calls that reach a desired
world state, is the job of a middleware that does not exist and is not part of this project. Items
below may make the API easier for such a caller to drive (describing its own commands, dry-running
one, structured refusals), but never interpret text or plan on a caller's behalf.

## Priorities

Work top to bottom; take the first entry that is not blocked. Reorder here, nowhere else.

1. Presets, field tiers and roles: [plans/presets-and-roles.md](plans/presets-and-roles.md),
   blocks 1–8 in its order. Its open questions must be settled before block 4.
2. Candidates without a plan yet (below): write the item, then build it.

## How the work runs

One item at a time on `main`. Sessions that run in parallel each work in their own git worktree and
commit only their own files. Additions to the shared registration points (`src/engine/verbs/index.ts`,
`src/errors.ts`, `src/contract.ts`, the verb table in `tests/property-gen.ts`, the `docs/verbs.md`
index, `CLAUDE.md`) are one line or one entry each, so parallel work conflicts at most trivially.

## Out of scope

- Prose or intent → calls, and planning calls toward a goal state: the middleware's job.
- A web/HTTP server: the API is in-process; the CLI is the only adapter.
- Any Story-writer integration: a decision for that repo, if a middleware ever exists.
- The social resolver (mechanical state only: `alert`, `locked_by_order`), a generic relation graph,
  and continuous physics (Rapier/Box2D): revisit only when a concrete world needs them.
- A `distance` query: facts are true, false or unknown, and positions are in every observation.
- The verbs `turn` (it needs a facing direction), `use` (too general), `throw` (it would deal impact damage
  to agents) and `bandage` (a bleed stops by its count).
- Pathfinding: a caller routes around a barrier in several moves. Agents acting in parallel: a `beat` is an
  ordered batch, and two commands never share a tick.
- A gate or door that crushes what is in its way (a prop turning it on, the damage deciding whether the thing
  is destroyed or stops the closure): postponed in favour of pushing aside.
- Migrating stored worlds between `schema_version`s: an older world is refused, never read as if it matched
  (AGENTS.md: no silent migration); a tool comes when a world must be kept.
- Raised and set aside until a scenario needs them: several parents per event (`causes: [...]`) and a stored
  `root_id`; stepping onto shards having a consequence; an agent slipping through a gap, and a head sized apart
  from the body for bites; a wound from a detachment written by `edit`.
- The limits in `docs/limits*.md`: none is worth a verb yet, except as listed under candidates.

## Items

Every item is ready now and names anything it leans on; the order is under Priorities.

None is planned now.

## Candidates

Known gaps with no plan yet. Promote one by writing it up as an item above.

- **Actors learn that unseen others acted.** `observation.version` and a `preempted` status reveal
  commands the actor could not perceive, through `actorWorld` and the `actor_*` ops; the open decision
  is whether an actor view should hide them.
- **Facing and a sight cone.** In a lit room every act is seen (`docs/limits.md`); the costliest of
  the limits, revisit when a concrete world needs what darkness, concealment and staging cannot give.
